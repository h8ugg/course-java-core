Gee wheeze baby please
Let me take you to an island of the sweet cool breeze
You don't feel like drive baby hand me the keys
And I'll take you to a place to set your mind of ease
Don't you tickle my foot bottom ha ha baby please
Don't you play with my nose I might Ha chum sneeze

Well you a the bun and me the cheese
And if me the rice well you the peas
Chorus
Give me your loving gal your loving well good
I want your loving gal give it like you should
Give your loving gal you loving well good
I want your loving gal you remember the woo...
Would like to kiss and carress
Rub down every strand of hair on my chest
